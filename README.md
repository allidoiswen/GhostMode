Credit Card Fraud

Credit card fraud is a persistent issue and one that credit card companies and banks constantly need to consider. Many banks and credit card companies offer free monitoring and alerts in an attempt to identify potentially fraudulent activity as soon as possible. With the standard practice of reimbursing customers for fraudulent charges on their credit cards and accounts, it is in the best interest of credit card companies and banks to identify, stop and prevent fraudulent activity.

The purpose of this project is to create a machine learning model to identify credit card fraud based on transactions. This will be accomplished using cloud-based ETL, machine learning and an interactive component. The dataset contains 284,807 rows 31 columns.
